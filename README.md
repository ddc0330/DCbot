# DCbot

A simple Discord bot that listens for users joining voice channels and sends a notification message to a designated text channel.

## Features
- Sends a message when a user joins any voice channel.

## Deployment
This bot is designed to run on [Render](https://render.com) using the **free Web Service** plan.

## Why an HTTP Server?
Render's free Web Service requires the app to bind to an HTTP port.  
Since Discord bots don't need an HTTP interface, a dummy HTTP server is included **only to keep Render from shutting the service down**.  
This does not affect the botâ€™s functionality.
(A fake HTTP server is used just to keep Render happy)
